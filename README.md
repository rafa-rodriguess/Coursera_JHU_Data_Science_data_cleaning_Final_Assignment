# Getting and Cleaning Data - Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example [this article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/). Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## On This Project:

- **README.md** - this file
- **CodeBook.md** - a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data
- **run_analysis.R** - R code
- **Coursera\_JHU\_Data\_Science\_data\_cleaning\_Final\_Assignment.Rproj** - R project

## How to Run:

Run **run_analysis.R**
